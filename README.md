# Reinforcement Learning Playground

## What is reinforcement learning?

- Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning.
- Involves an agent and environment.
- Agents learns optimal for maximizing rewards.

## Why learn RL?

- Not just for games
- Make optimal decisions
- Maximize efficiency

## What are RL applications?

- Robotics
- Self-driving cars
- Inventory management
- Finantial investments
- Decision-based situations

## RL terminology

### What is the agent?

- The agent is the algorithm
- Decides which action to tale
- Agent monitors the environment
- Who is learning
- It's only outcome are decisions(actions, controls)

### What is an environment?

- The environment is everything the agent can interact with.
- Agent's actions affect the environment.

### What is a state?

- The state is a representation of what the agent can sense.
- Does not always involve the entire environment. It's limited to what the agent can sense.

### What is an action?

- An action is what an agent can do is a given state.
- Actions are limited by the environment.
- The action's goal is to maximize reward.

### What is the reward?

- Result from making an action.
- Feedback from the environment.
- It can be positive or negative.
- Helps encorage or discourage certain actions, policies or behaivours.
- Is what the agent tries to optimize

### What is the standard reinforcement loop?

- TODO
