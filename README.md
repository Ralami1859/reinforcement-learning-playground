# Reinforcement Learning Playground

## What is reinforcement learning?

- Reinforcement learning is a branch of machine learning.
- Involves an agent and environment.
- Agents learns optimal for maximizing rewards.

### When should we worry about sequential decision making?

Limited supervision: you know what you want, but not how to get it.

Late consequences?

## Why learn RL?

- Not just for games
- Make optimal decisions
- Maximize efficiency

## What are RL applications?

- Robotics
- Self-driving cars
- Inventory management
- Finantial investments
- Decision-based situations

## RL terminology

### What is the agent?

- The agent is the algorithm
- Decides which action to tale
- Agent monitors the environment
- Who is learning
- It's only outcome are decisions(actions, controls)

### What is an environment?

- The environment is everything the agent can interact with.
- Agent's actions affect the environment.
- It responds to actor's actions with consequences(observations, rewards estimation)

### What is a state?

- The state is a representation of what the agent can sense.
- Does not always involve the entire environment. It's limited to what the agent can sense.

### What is an action?

- An action is what an agent can do is a given state.
- Actions are limited by the environment.
- The action's goal is to maximize reward.

### What is the reward?

- Result from making an action.
- Feedback from the environment.
- It can be positive or negative.
- Helps encourage or discourage certain actions, policies or behaivours.
- Is what the agent tries to optimize.
- Rewards are hard to formulate.

#### Where do rewards come from?

- When playing video games, rewards come from scores.

#### Are there other forms of supervision?

- Learning from demostrations.
    - Directly copying observed behavior.
    - Inferring rewards from observed behavior.
    
- Learning from observing the world.
    - Learning to predict.
    - Unsupervised Learning
    
- Learning from other tasks
    - Transfer learning
    

### What is the standard reinforcement loop?

- TODO

### What is Deep Reinforcement Learning?

- Deep learning: end-to-end training of expressive, multi-layer models.
- Deep models are what allow RL algorithms to solve complex problems end-to-end.

#### Why Deep Reinforcement Learning?

- Deep = can process complex sensory input

#### What can deep learning & RL do well now?

- Adquire high degree of proficiency in domains governed by simple, known rules.
- Learn simple skills with raw sensory inputs, given enough experience.
- Learn from imitating enough human-provided expert behavior.

#### What has proven challenging so far?

- Humans can learn incredibly quickly
- Humans can reuse past knowledge
    - Transfer learning in deep RL is an open problem
- Not clear what the reward function should be


### How do we build intelligent machines?

Learning as the basis of intelligence.

- Some things we can all do.
- Some things we can only learn.
